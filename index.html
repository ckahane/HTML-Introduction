      The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for
      documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It is often assisted
      by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting
      languages such as JavaScript.

    <p>
      Typography refers to the art and technique of arranging and styling
      typefaces (fonts) in a visually appealing and effective manner. It
      involves the design, selection, and arrangement of fonts, as well as the
      layout, spacing, and formatting of text elements.
    </p>

    <p>
      Typography plays a crucial role in various forms of visual communication,
      such as graphic design, advertising, print media, and web design. It
      encompasses both the aesthetic and functional aspects of text, aiming to
      enhance readability, convey information, and evoke specific emotions or
      moods.
    </p>

    <p>Key elements of typography include:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Typefaces (Fonts): Typefaces are sets of characters that share a
        consistent design style. They come in various categories, such as serif
        (with small decorative lines at the ends of characters), sans-serif
        (without decorative lines), script, display, and more. The choice of
        typeface greatly influences the tone and character of the text.
      </li>
      <li>
        Font Styles and Variations: Fonts often have different styles and
        variations, such as regular, bold, italic, and condensed. These
        variations can be used to emphasize specific words or sections of text,
        create hierarchy, and add visual interest.
      </li>
      <li>
        Font Size: The size of the typeface determines how large or small the
        text appears. It affects readability and visual hierarchy within the
        content.
      </li>
      <li>
        Line Length and Width: The width of the text block, also known as the
        line length, should be carefully considered to ensure optimal
        readability. Lines that are too long or too short can negatively impact
        the reading experience.
      </li>
      <li>
        Line Spacing and Leading: Line spacing refers to the vertical space
        between lines of text, while leading specifically refers to the distance
        between the baselines of consecutive lines. Appropriate line spacing and
        leading are essential for legibility and comfortable reading.
      </li>
      <li>
        Alignment and Justification: Text can be aligned to the left, right,
        center, or justified (aligned on both sides). Alignment choices
        influence the visual appearance and readability of the text.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tracking and Kerning: Tracking refers to adjusting the overall spacing
        between characters, while kerning involves adjusting the spacing between
        specific pairs of characters. These adjustments ensure even and visually
        pleasing letter spacing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Hierarchy and Emphasis: Typography helps create a visual hierarchy by
        differentiating headings, subheadings, body text, and other elements.
        Variation in font size, weight, color, or style can be used to emphasize
        important information and guide readers through the content.
      </li>
      <li>
        Contrast and Color: Contrast between the text and its background is
        crucial for legibility. Additionally, color can be used to evoke
        emotions, highlight key elements, or create visual interest within the
        typography.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Typography requires a balance between aesthetics and functionality. Good
      typography enhances the readability, accessibility, and overall visual
      impact of written content, helping to effectively communicate messages to
      the audience.

    <h3>Definition of HTML Typography</h3>

    <p>
      HTML typography refers to the styling and formatting of text on a web page
      using HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). It involves using HTML tags and
      CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) properties to control the appearance, layout,
      and behavior of the text. With CSS, you have extensive control over the
      appearance of text, allowing you to create visually appealing and readable
      content on web pages.
